# Metronic Tailwind Angular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.8.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, you will need to purchase the Metronic theme, which includes the Tailwind CSS source files. After purchasing, follow these steps:

### Installation

1. Copy the `src` folder from the `metronic-tailwind-html` package and paste it into the `src` directory of your Angular project. Rename the copied folder to `metronic` so that the directory structure should now look like this: `tailwind-angular/src/metronic`. This step imports the necessary styles and assets from the original HTML package into your Angular project.

2. Copy the `media` folder from the `metronic-tailwind-html` package's `dist/assets/media` directory into your Angular project's `src/assets` directory. The resulting directory structure should look like this: `tailwind-angular/src/assets/metronic/assets`.

3. Install the required Node.js packages by running `npm install` in the root directory of your Angular project.

4. Build the assets by running `ng build` in the root directory of your Angular project.

5. Start the Angular development server by running `ng serve`.

That's it! You now have the Metronic Tailwind template integrated into your Angular project.
